Google Cloud Documentation notes




Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers a wide range of foundational services across various domains.

Computing:
These services provide the computational power to run applications and manage workloads.
Compute Engine (AWS EC2): Virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud. It allows you to deploy scalable VMs with your choice of operating system and software.
App Engine (AWS Elastic Beanstalk): A fully managed platform for building and deploying applications without worrying about infrastructure. It supports multiple programming languages.
Cloud Functions (AWS Lambda): A serverless execution environment for running lightweight, event-driven functions.
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) (AWS EKS): A managed Kubernetes service for running containerized applications.
Cloud Run (AWS Fargate): A serverless platform for running containerized applications triggered by HTTP requests or events.

Networking:
These services handle network connectivity, security, and content delivery.
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) (AWS VPC): Provides isolated networking environments with customizable subnets, firewalls, and routing.
Cloud Load Balancing (AWS ELB): Distributes traffic across multiple resources to ensure availability and performance.
Cloud CDN (Content Delivery Network) (AWS Cloudfront): Speeds up content delivery by caching it closer to end-users globally.
Cloud Interconnect (AWS DirectConnect): Enables secure, high-speed connections between on-premises infrastructure and GCP.
Cloud DNS (AWS ROUTE53): A scalable, reliable, and managed DNS service for hosting domain names.
Cloud NAT(AWS NAT GATEWAY): Provides managed network address translation for instances without external IPs.

Storage:
GCP offers various storage solutions based on use cases like object storage, databases, and data archiving.
Cloud Storage (AWS S3): Scalable object storage for unstructured data (images, videos, backups).
Persistent Disk (AWS EBS): Block storage for Compute Engine VMs.
Filestore (AWS EFS): Managed file storage for applications that require a file system interface.
Bigtable (AWS Keyspaces or DynamoDB): A NoSQL database for high-throughput workloads like IoT and analytics.
Cloud SQL (AWS RDS): Managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).
Cloud Spanner (AWS Aurora): A global-scale relational database for applications needing strong consistency and high availability.
Cloud Firestore (AWS DynamoDB): A NoSQL database for mobile, web, and server development.

Content Delivery:
Services to enhance content delivery for faster and reliable user experiences.
Cloud CDN (AWS CloudFront): Serves content from Google's globally distributed edge locations for low-latency access.
Media CDN (AWS CloudFront): Optimized for streaming large volumes of media content with high performance.

Administration and Security:
Tools and services to ensure your GCP environment is secure and manageable.
Cloud IAM (Identity and Access Management) (AWS IAM): Manages access to GCP resources with fine-grained permissions.
Cloud Identity (AWS IAM & Directory Service): A unified solution for identity and access management.
Security Command Center (AWS SecurityHub): A security and risk management platform for identifying vulnerabilities.
Cloud Key Management (KMS) (AWS KMS): Manages cryptographic keys securely.
Cloud Audit Logs (AWS CloudTrail): Tracks activities in your GCP environment for auditing and troubleshooting.

Deployment and Management:
Tools to manage and automate application deployment and resource configuration.
Cloud Deployment Manager (AWS CloudFormation): Automates resource deployment using configuration files.
Terraform on GCP: An open-source infrastructure as code tool for managing GCP resources.
Cloud Monitoring (AWS CloudWatch): Observes the health of your applications and infrastructure.
Cloud Logging (AWS CloudWatch Logs): Centralized log management and analysis for GCP resources.
Cloud Profiler (AWS X-RAY): Analyzes application performance to identify bottlenecks.

Automation Technologies:
Services for automating tasks and workflows in your environment.
Cloud Build (AWS CodeBuild): A CI/CD tool for building, testing, and deploying code.
Cloud Composer (AWS Glue): A managed Apache Airflow service for orchestrating workflows.
Cloud Tasks (AWS SQS): A service for asynchronous task execution and delivery.
Cloud Scheduler (AWS EventBridge/CloudWatchEvents): A fully managed cron job service for task scheduling.
